	08:23 T_cav = 583.4 mK, T_m	= 288 mK.
	Note: The mixing chamber temperature has been around 200 mK for an entire night, yet the cavity temperature couldn't get below 500 mK. Suspecting heat leak through the coax cable.
Apr. 09, 2019
	10:12 Start ramping the magnetic field from 0 to 5 T at 0.002 T/min. Recording S11 on ZVL network analyzer, temperature from Lakeshore 370B. T_cav = 0.584 K.
	12:00 T_cav = 0.588 K. Change DC magnetic field ramping speed to 0.008 T/min.
		Note: The previous ramping speed 0.002 T/min appeared to have very little heating effect as the cavity temperature stayed at 0.588 K.
	13:00 T_cav = 0.587 K, change the DC magnetic ramping speed to 0.016
	15:20 T_cav = 0.600 K, field = 3.041 T.
	16:49 T_cav = 0.591 K, field = 3.373 T.
	17:27 Field = 5.000 T, start to ramp down to zero.
	17:47 T_cav = 0.575 K. Changet ramping rate to 0.02 T/min.

	Lowest temperature reached by the cavity was 241.5 mK.
Apr. 14, 2019
	16:32 The S11 signal (coupling) recovered at room temperature under vacuum.
		Note: the recovery suggests that the change in coupling deterioration was due to inductance and capacitance change at low temperature, possibly primarily of the coax cable.
Apr. 15, 2019
	Warning: The LiHoF4 sample was discovered to be shattered and displaced from the original position inside the cavity. Possibly explanation is the violent boiling of liquid nitrogen during submersion experiment for quick cool down to inspect the coupling betwqeen the antenna and the cavity.The liquid nitrogen can get inside the cavity during the submersion and damage the sample. Another possible explanation is the accelerated cool-down and warm-up cycle during the nitrogen submersion experiment when, the sample was quickly cooled by being submerged into liquid nitrogen and then quickly warmed up subsequently using a heat gun.
	Note: After cooling down, the partially decoupled cavity again didn't yield a decernible absorption peak in S11 curve. The observation of the cool down process from 200+ K to 4 K shows a constant drift of the signal on Smith plot from the origin toward the negative direction along the imaginary axis (an increasing capacitance), without change in size of the loop. The coupling between the antenna and the cavity appears to be unchanged during the entire process, indicating it is the coax cable part of the transmission line that changed the most during the cool down.
	LiHoF4 sample as glued to the cavit at the bottom using GE varnish, cured over night at room temperature.
Apr. 16, 2019
	Note: The absorption peak reappeared, suspecting the disappearance during the cool down was due to a dynamic process and the reappearance when an equilibrium is reached.
	10:46 T_cav = 159.6 mK.
	20:09 T_mc = 77.8 mK, T_cold = 223.8 mK, T_still = 1.18 K, P4 = 0.89 mBar, T_cav = 154.3 mK. Start sweeping magnetic field from 0 to 5 T at 0.016 T/min. 4He level = 54.1%.
Apr. 18, 2019
	LiHoF4 sample secured inside a cylinder mould, which was then filled up with stycast, and cured together at 70C for two hours, the block was then cut and sanded down to fit the cavity tightly and GE varnish was applied at the top and bottom of the sample.
	14:40 The absorption peak on S11 disappeared around 50 K.
	Note: Based on the last cool-down, it appears that waht matters is not just the coupling betweeen the antenna and the cavity but as well as the charateristics of the coax cable at low temperature. The absorption peak may be recovered should the circuit is tuned externally with additional LC components.
	17:32 T_cav = 935 mK, the absorption peak on S11 recovered.

	Note: It is observed that the frequency range doesn't follow the setup, the cause is found to be that the ZVL network analyzer outputs 31 number of points (nop) per communication, and the frequency span of each communication is thus to be (31-1) * 0.1 MHz (steps: 0.1 MHz) = 3.0 MHz. Therefore, the total frequency span has to be an integer multile of 3.0 MHz.

	19:30 Set the mixing chamber temperature to 500 mK.
		Note: By comparing data taken with magnetic field sweeping speed at 0.015 T/min and 0.020 T/min, it appears that there is visible difference in qualities of the data in color maps between the two speed, and the slower (0.015 T/min) is preferred.
