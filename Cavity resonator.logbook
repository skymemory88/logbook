	16:18 attached the LiHoF4 sample to the cavity resonator (d24mm_t5mm_g0.2mm) with GE vanish and ac plane facing upward.
	17:49 Mount the cavity onto the mixing chamber plate, thermalize through copper wires (0.2 mm, unstripped). Connect the weaklink thermometer to connector No.1.
	17:50 Detune (red-shift) the coupling between the cavity and antenna.
	17:55 Mount the radiation shield onto the cold plate.
	18:20 Close up the vacuum chamber and start pumping on it. Start pumping on the dilution fridge unit at the same time.
