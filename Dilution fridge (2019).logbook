	21:02 Change still heater power to 3.5 mW.
	21:43 Changed still heater power to 5 mW.
	22:03 Turn off still heater.
	Note: Though the still heater increased P4 from ~0.7 mBar to 1.2 mBar, there is no imporvement to cooling power. Hypothetically it is because it only increased evaporation of helium-4 but not that of helium-3, and therefore doesn't contribute to sub-kelvin cooling power.

		Note: The cold plate temperature appears to be oppositely correlated with the mixing chamber temperature. The increas of cooling power resulted from the still heater suggests the liquid level is still inside the still and the temperature of the mixing chamber as well as the gap between it and that of the cold plate temperature suggest the phase separation is either inside the mixing chamber or very close to.

		Note: V1 was accidentally closed for four minutes since 22:24 until 22:28, this accounts for the drop in P5 and increase of P2.
	22:42 T_mc = 170.1 mK, T_cold = 137.9 mK, T_still = 898 mK. P4 = 1.4 mBar. Turn off still heater.

	10:46 T_mc = 30.6 mK (flattening out), T_cold = 68.6 mK, T_still = 932 mK, P4 = 1.2 mBar. Change the still heater power to 8 mW.
	10:55 T_mc = 30.5 mK, T_cold = 73.91 mK, T_still = 1.04 K, P4 = 1.6 mBar. turn off still heater.
		Note: Increase still heater power appears to have immediately increased the outgoing flow and hence P4, but no extra cooling power achieved as mixing chamber temperature didn't change.
	11:32 T_mc = 30.2 mK, T_cold = 58.05 mK, T_still = 735 mK. P4= 0.57 mBar, P1 = 0.030 Bar, open V4 to remove 5 mBar of mixture.

	12:17 T_mc = 29.7 mK, T_cold = 68.9 mK, T_still = 933 mK, P4 = 1.1 mBar. Turn off still heater.
		Note: Still heater appears to have no effect on cooling power at this point when there are 35 mBar of mixture in the dump, and mixing chamber temperature is at ~30 mK.

	17:27 T_mc = 44.15 mK, turn on still heater (5 mW).
	17:41 T_mc = 42.51 mK, turn off still heater.
	18:11 T_mc = 43.76 mK.
		Note: still heater added additional cooling power as the temperature droped slightly, and recovered when the heater is off.
	18:12 T_still = 731 mK, T_cold = 60.25 mK, P4 = 0.60 mBar. Open v4 to remove 10 mBar of mixture.
	18:23 P1 = 0.030 Bar, close V4.
	19:06 T_mc = 32.3 mK and is still dropping. T_cold = 58.2 mK, T_still = 735 mK. P4 = 0.59 mBar, P1 = 0.030 Bar. Start cooling power measurement at 100 mK using PID.
	19:10 P_cool(100 mK) = 80 uW (0.4 mW * 0.4 mW * 500 ohm). T_still = 725 mK.

	20:55 T_mc = 32.9 mK, T_cold = 57.7 mK, T_still = 736 mK. Turn on still heater (5 mW).
	21:01 T_mc = 31.3 mK, T_cold = 68.2 mK, T_still = 932 mK. P1 = 0.030 Bar. Keep still heater (5 mW) on, start cooling power measurement at 100 mK using PID.
	23:01 T_mc = 100 mK, T_still = 923 mK (5 mW on still heater). P_cool (100 mK) = 125 uW (0.5 mW * 0.5 mW * 500 ohm).
		Note: the still heater added additional cooling power to the mixing chamber by about 45 uW.
	23:53 Turn off still heater.
Mar. 20, 2019
	09:36 T_mc = 29.7 mK, T_cold = 57.8 mK, T_still = 737 mK. P1 = 0.030 Bar, P4 = 0.61 mBar. Close V1, open V4, bypass valve to start collecting all mixture back to the dump. Stop 1K pot, switch off turbo pump, and turn on all heaters.
	10:50 P1 = 0.768 Bar and plateaued. Inject 3000 mBar-in-manifold of helium-4 into the dump. 4He level = 56.4%.
	11:35 P1 = 0.770 Bar. P_cryo = 41 mBar. Close V12, SV3 and by pass valve, start to remove helium trap from the cryostat.
	11:42 Turn off the turbo pump, close all valves, disconnected bellows and start removing the fridge from the cryostat.
	12:29 Fridge is removed and secured on rack. P_cryo = 40 mBar. 4He level = 47.2%.
		Note: A possible heat leak found between the mixing chamber and cold plate through touching the radiation shield. The heat leak is subsequently removed. Raidation shield mounted back on.
	16:08 P_cryo = 40 mBar, start inserting the fridge back into the cryostat. 4He level = 47.1%.
	17:50 Fridge insert complete, 4He level = 33.8%. P_cryo = 58 mBar.
	19:31 Start transferring helium into the cryostat, 4He level = 29.4%.
	20:18 4He level = 75.3%, stop transfer.
	20:31 Transfer complete, 4He level = 75.9%, P_cryo = 44 mBar.
Mar. 21, 2019
	08:08 Start 1K pot. Insert helium trap. 4He = 72.9%.
	09:16 Start condensing sequence. P1 = 0.768 Bar.
	10:09 Observed a large pressure difference between P2 and P5 (P2 / P5 = 254 / 629), Collect all mixtures back into the tank and prepare to clean the nitrogen trap.
	11:08 Switch off all heaters, close V12, SV3, and V4, turn off turbo pump. Extract helium trap, close SV1 and start pumping both traps.
	11:27 STart pumping on nitrogen trap while heating it with a heat gun set on low.
	12:30 Helium cold trap appears to be clean as the pressure quickly went down and stayed at 8E-8 mBar. Therefore stop pumping on helium trap, and re-insert it into the cryostat. Nitrogen trap appears to be contaminated as the pressure stayed high at 1.6E0 mBar, continue pumping it while heating it with a heat gun on low setting.
		Note: The nitrogen trap stayed at low vacuum for extended period of time (2E-3 mBar), suspect either it has water in it that is slowly evaporating, or there is a gross leak.
	13:50 swap the nitrogen trap to the spare one (the old one) and start pumping on them individually.
	14:05 Pressure inside the spare nitrogen trap dropped to 3E-5 mBar. Re-insert the nitrogen trap into the dewar.
	14:09 Start forepump.
	14:13 Open V5 and V1 to circulate the gas inside the bellows through the cold traps.
	14:15 T_1K = 1.93 K. Start 1K pot. Open V12, SV3, close bypass valve. Start condensing sequence.
	15:30 Suspect the fridge is blocked, close V1, open V4, V2, bypass valve to recollect all the mixtures back into the dump. Stop 1K pot, and turn on all heaters.
	15:49 Turn off all valves and start extrating helium cold trap.
	16:00 Start pumping on nitrogen trap outside the dewar with a heat gun set on low.
	16:30 The nitrogen trap appears to be clean.
	16:45 Extraction complete, 4He level = 59.8%
	17:00 Start pumping on the dilution fridge at room temperature.
	17:01 P_cryo = 31 mBar.
	17:16 Nitrogen trap suddenly had a pressure jump from 3E-5 mBar to 2E-2 mBar.
		Note: The pressure bump appeared more than an hour after I started pumping the nitrogen trap, suggesting there may be ice/water inside and started to melt as the temperature goes up.
Mar. 22, 2019
	08:30 The pressure inside the dilution fridge reached 2.6E-6 mBar, close all valves and stop the pump. Start pumping on the vacuum chamber.
	08:35 The pressure inside the nitrogen trap reached 4.3E-5 mBar, close all valves and stop the pump. Reinsert the nitrogen cold trap into the dewar.
	10:45 IVC pressure reached 8E-5 mBar. Start insert the fridge into the cryostat.
	12:45 Insert complete, P_cryo = 47 mBar. Start pumping on bellows. 4He level = 48.3%.
	13:50 Load the helium cold trap into the cryostat.
	14:00 Helium trap insert complete. P_cryo = 39 mBar, P1 = 0.768 Bar, test the circulation by releasing some mixture from the dump into the circulation without going through the fridge but the bypass valve.
	14:00 Close bypass valve, open V12 and SV3, start condensing sequence.
	15:00 The condensing sequence appears to be stuck, switch to manual condensing.
	15:20 Switch back to automated condensing sequence.
	15:45 Stop automated condensing sequence, recollect all mixtures back into the dump.
		Note: As the temperatures of all three stages (Still, cold plate, and mixing chamber) dewelled above 2K for very long time, deviated from the usual cool down trajectory, it is suspected that the fridge is well thermalized to the cryostat for possibily too much exchange gas inside with a malfunctioning sorb.
	16:00 Turn on all heaters, and start pumping on IVC.
	16:21 P_ivc = 1.8E-5 mBar, close the IVC valve, turn off all heaters and start the condensing sequence again. P1 = 0.768 Bar.
		Note: The second attempt of cooling down after pumping out the exchange gas succeeded, suggesting the correctness of the suspicion that it was a thermalization problem that prevented condensing during the first attempt.
	19:20 Start transfer helium. 4He level = 40.8%.
	19:25 T_mc = reached 81 mK (18:37) and then start to bouncing back up. P1 = 0.013 Bar.
	19:30 Helium transfer appeared to have interfered with 1K pot and T_1K rose up to 4.2 K. Immediately switch off turbo pump, open V4 and close V1 as P5 rose to 500+ mBar.
	19:32 Pressure stabilizes and T_1K = 1.8 K, open V1, close V4, and open V9 to empty the dump.
	19:40 P2 = 218 mBar, P5 = 70 mBar, P1 = 0.032 Bar, P4 = 1.2 mBar. T_mc = 247.8 mK, T_cold = 223.9 mK, T_still = 917 mK, T_1K = 1.57 K. 
	20:18 4He level = 77.7%, stop tranferring.
	20:33 4He level = 80.8%. T_mc = 394 mK, T_still = 864 mK, T_cold = 316 mK. P1 = 0.005 Bar. 
	20:50 Start Turbo pump. P1 = 0.003 Bar.
	22:15 P1 = 0.000 Bar. T_mc = 255.4 mK, T_cold = 200 mK, T_still = 694 mK. P4 = 1.50 mBar. Turn on still heater (5mW).
	22:33 T_mc = 251 mK, T_cold = 200.2 mK, T_still = 923 mK, P4 = 2.2 mBar. Turn off still heater.
		Note: The still heater appeared to have no significant effect on the cooling power.
	22:47 T_mc = 258 mK, T_cold = 202.7 mK, T_still = 696 mK. Open V4 to remove 10 mBar of mixture.
	22:52 P1 = 0.010 Bar, close V4.

	11:50 P1 = 0.015 Bar, close V4.
Mar. 23, 2019
	08:01 P1 = 0.015 Bar, T_mc = 82.05 mK, T_cold = 79.42 mK, T_still = 745 mK, all temperatures have plateaued for the last 6 hours. P2 = 202 mBar, P5 = 77 mBar, P4 = 1.1 mBar. Turn on still heater (5 mW).
	09:19 T_mc = 69.8 mK, T_cold = 81.2 mK, T_still = 954 mK. Turn off still heater.
	10:00 T_still = 749 mK. Open V9 to empty the dump.
		Note: The still temperature is too high, removing mixture at this temperature almost inevitably remove helium-4 along with its isotope. Open V9 usually reduces still temperature so that pure helium-3 can be removed.
	10:51 T_still = 717 mK, T_mc = 243 mK, T_cold = 191 mK. Close V9 and open V4 to remove mixture.
	11:20 P1 = 0.021 Bar, close V4. T_still = 550 mK.
	14:42 T_mc = 53.11 mK, T_cold = 66.47 mK, T_still = 756 mK, P4 = 1.0 mBar. P1 = 0.021 Bar. Open V9 to empty the dump and lower the still temperature.
	16:21 T_still = 700 mK, P1 = 0.001 Bar. P4 = 1.4 mBar. Close V9, V1, and open V4.
	17:07 P1 = 0.025 Bar, close V4. T_still = 528 mK, P4 = 0.8 mBar.
	18:14 P2 rose over 1 Bar, open V4 to release the pressure to the dump.
	Note: V1 was left closed erroneously when V4 was closed, and therefore the pressure behind the forepump rose up quite, and possibly dangerously, high. The turbo pump efficiency was noted subsequently dropped as the power input rose to the maximum (350 W) while the spinning speed was only 680 rpm (820 rpm under normal circumstances). For furture reference, the status of circulation should be inspected after every operation. 
	18:15 Open V9 to empty the dump.
	19:25 P1 = 0.003 Bar, close V9 and open V4 to recollect 22 mBar of mixture from circulation.
	Note: All systems, including the pressures and pumps, appear to have regained balance and recovered to normal state
	19:30 T_still = 613 mK. Briefly close V4 and open V9 to put back some of the mixture and take advantage of the low temperature of the still to collect as much mixture with as pure helium-3 as possible.
	19:39 T_still = 702 mK, close V4 and open V9 to start collecting mixtures again.
	19:40 T_still = 0.601 K, close V1 to expedite the process.
	19:51 P1 = 0.025 mBar, close V4 and open V1.
	22:21 T_mc = 45.2 mK, T_cold = 64.0 mK, T_still = 756 mK. P4 = 1.0 mBar. Turn on still heater (5 mW).
	23:06 T_mc = 49.9 mK, T_cold = 74.3 mK, T_still = 963 mK. P4 = 1.81 mBar. Turn off still heater.
		Note: The still heater didn't appear to have helped with the cooling power.
	23:25 T_mc = 50.4 mK, T_cold = 65.7 mK, T_still = 755 mK. P4 = 1.10 mBar. Open V9 to put back some mixture into the circulation and lower the still temperature.
	23:56 T_still = 738 mK. Close V9 and open V4.
Mar. 24, 2019
	00:08 T_still = 567 mK. Close V1 to expedite the process.
	01:00 P1 = 0.030 Bar, T_still = 529 mK. close V4 and open V1.
	09:20 T_mc = 47.3 mK, T_still = 747 mK. P4 = 1.0 mBar. Turn on still heater (5 mW).
		Note: P4 appears to be higher than usual at this still temperature.
	10:25 T_mc = 51.1 mK, T_cold = 74.6 mK, T_still = 960 mK. P4 = 1.8 mBar. Turn off still heater and open V9 to empty the dump.
		Note: The still heater appears to have negatively impacted the cooling power.
	11:43 T_mc = 256.7 mK, T_cold = 201.3 mK, T_still = 713 mK. P4 = 1.40 mBar, P1 = 0.003 Bar. Close V9, open V4.
		Note: Closing V1 when collecting part of the mixtures, thought speed up the process, is speculated to be hindering collecting pure helium-3. Hence now attempt to recollect mixtures with V1 open and hence the circulation is somewhat kept going.
	11:52 T_still = 540 mK, P4 = 0.11 mBar.
	12:40 P1 = 0.032 Bar. Close V4 and open V9 to adjust P1 to 0.030 Bar.
	12:42 P1 = 0.030 Bar, close V9.
	14:36 T_mc = 39.54 mK, T_cold = 59.9 mK, T_still = 759 mK. All temperatures appears to be flating out. P2 = 191 mBar, P5 = 74 mBar. P4 = 0.95 mBar. Turn on still heater (5 mW).
	15:04 T_mc = 41.8 mK, T_cold = 70.16 mK, T_still = 962 mK.
		Note: It appears that the still heater initially helped the mixing chamber gain cooling power (T_mc = 38.5 mK) and as the still temperature rose up, more helium-4 was mixed in the vapor, hampering the pumping rate of helium-3 which provide the cooling power, and the mixing chamber subsequently start to warming up.
	15:06 Reduce still heater heating power (5 mW -> 2 mW).
	15:58 T_mc appeas to plateauded at 41.9 mK, T_still = 838 mK. Increase the heating power from 2 mW to 3 mW.
	16:13 Turn off still heater.
		Note: The increase in the still heater heating power didn't appear to help with the cooling power. As P4 is still higher than usual, prepare to cool down still and remove 5 mBar of mixture (mostly helium-3 at low temperature).
	16:51 T_still = 758 mK, P1 = 0.030 Bar. Open V4 to remove some mixture.
	16:56 P1 = 0.040 mBar, close V4. T_still = 625 mK.
	17:54 T_mc = 30.83 mK and plateaued. T_still = 764 mK, P4 = 0.97 mBar. Turn on still heater (3 mW).
	18:27 T_mc = 30.76 mK. T_still = 882 mK, change still heater power to 4 mW.
	19:00 T_mc = 30.88 mK, T_still = 925 mK, P4 = 1.5 mBar. Turn off still heater. Open V9 and let in 10 mBar of mixture to the circulation.
	21:00 T_mc = 40.1 mK, T_cold = 60.4 mK, T_still = 759 mK. Turn on still heater (3 mW). P4 = 0.96 mBar.
	21:28 T_mc = 40.44 mK, T_cold = 65.8 mK, T_still = 881 mK, P4 = 1.5 mBar, P1 = 0.030 Bar. Turn off still heater. Open V9 to let in 5 mBar of mixture.
	21:34 P1 = 0.025 mBar. close V9.
	22:00 T_mc = 46.9 mK, T_cold = 62.3 mK, T_still = 755 mK. P4 = 1.0 mBar. Turn on still heater (3 mW).
	22:39 T_mc = 48.7 mK, T_cold = 68.3 mK, T_still = 881 mK. P4 = 1.5 mBar. Turn off still heater and open V9 to let in more mixture.
		Note: The still heater again didn't help with cooling power.
	23:10 T_still = 737 mK, close V9 and open V4.

	10:40 Cooling power measured to be 96.8 uW (0.44 mA * 0.44 mA * 500 ohm). Turn off the mixing chamber heater.
	16:00 T_mc = 26.7 mK. Stop logging to calibrate the thermometers.
Mar. 26, 2019
	10:50 T_mc = 26.9 mK, P1 = 0.035 Bar, open V9 and let in 2 mBar of mixture into the circulation.

	12:51 P1 = 0.040 mBar.
	13:01 T_mc = 24.3 mK, T_cold = 62.8 mK, T_still = 764 mK. P4 = 0.89 ~ 1.0 mBar.
		Note: P4 appears to be repeating a cyclic motion between 1.0 mBar and 0.89 mBar. The cause is unknown (a dynamic evaporation perhaps).
	13:08 Open V4 and remove 2 mBar of mixture.
	13:09 P1 = 0.042 Bar.
	14:08 T_mc = 23.7 mK, T_cold = 62.8 mK, T_still = 761 mK. P4 = 0.95 mBar. Open P4 and remove 2 mBar of mixture.

	14:50 T_mc = 23.3 mK, T_cold = 62.8 mK, T_still = 764 mK. P4 = 0.93 mBar.
	15:01 Start cooling power measurement at 100 mK using mixing chamber heater with P = 2, I = 50, D = 10.
	15:45 T_mc = 100 mK. P_cool(100 mK) = 135.4 uW (0.52 mA * 0.52 mA * 500 ohm). Turn off mixing chamber heater.
Mar. 27, 2019
